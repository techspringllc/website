      <description>Are you falling behind on delivering product work? Do servers go unpatched because no one has time to do updates? Is anyone on your team really qualified to manage infrastructure security?  Imagine getting that time back.  Imagine having more time to devote to project work. Imagine never wondering if the latest CVE was patched. Imagine knowing that a team of dedicated network security pros are watching your infrastructure.</description>

      <description>techspring is on a mission to help startups get developer time back by removing operations work from their schedule. Developer time is valuable and any time spent away from building the product and crushing bugs is wasted.
We help get startups through the &amp;ldquo;too small for ops&amp;rdquo; phase until the time is right for managing their own infrastructure.</description>
